## Nobody Deserves to Enjoy Your Event More Than You.

Since 2015 Party Girl Events has been helping awesome clients plan and execute weddings and events that are smooth flowing and memorable. We've been everywhere from mountain tops to farms, from back yards to swanky ballrooms. We've worked through crazy snowstorms, fixed ripped bridesmaid's dresses, air brushed a sunburnt groom's forehead, and re-stacked wedding cakes on the fly. 

We love planning all events. It doesn't matter how big or small, what the budget is, or how out of the box the vision. As long as you're excited about it, then we'd love to be a part of it!
