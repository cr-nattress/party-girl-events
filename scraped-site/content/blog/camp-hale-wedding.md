# Erika and Eric's Mountain + Elegant Wedding at Camp Hale

I loved everything about this wedding! Erika and Eric were one of my favorite couples I've ever worked with, and the wedding was so much fun that I was sad when it was over!

## The Venue

[Camp Hale](https://www.camphaleweddings.com/weddings) is one of my top 3 favorite wedding venues! You might have seen it on the news in October when Joe Biden declared it a national monument because of its history! It has a beautiful tent that would probably cost over 30K to recreate, and a wedding ceremony island! It's off the grid in Red Cliff, which is 30 min. from Vail Village, and it's a dream come true for any couple who wants to give their guests a Colorado Mountain experience!

## Highlights

### Ceremony
The ceremony was really special! Erika's bridesmaid, Sammie, was the officiant, and she did a fantastic job! Erica and Erik wrote their own vows, and they were beautiful! They ended the ceremony with a rose petal toss exit!

### The Grand Entrance
Eric and Erika had their grand entrance to the song "This is America" because their hashtag was #thisisamerika, and then they had a mini dance set! I love a mini dance set especially when there's a really good band like [Great Family Reunion](https://greatfamilyreunion.net/)!

### Speeches
The speeches were all really great, but the maid of honor's speech was the best I've ever heard!

### Entertainment
The dance floor was full all night long!

We had [Sociallight's](http://socialitephoto.com/) Beauty Booth like the ones Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton use at their parties. 10 out of 10 recommend! Everyone loved it!

### Sparkler Sendoff
Perfect ending to a perfect night!

## Kind Words from the Bride

> WOW – just WOW! Stephanie and her team are experts. Let me start by saying I am a neurotic perfectionist, and Stephanie was able to help me plan my wedding without a SINGLE thing going awry. She always made herself available for any questions/concerns, always kept a smile on her face, and made every single detail come to life in the most perfect way. She was involved every step of the way. I never had to ask her twice for anything. I promise you that you will NOT regret hiring Stephanie and her team, she is the dream wedding planner that every bride deserves!!!
