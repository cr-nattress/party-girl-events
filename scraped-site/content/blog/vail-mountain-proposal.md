# Christine and Machi's Vail Mountain Proposal

What a way to kick off engagement season! Christine and Machi's marriage proposal was one of the best that we've ever seen! It had a beautiful setup, stunning backdrop, sentimental details, and Machi even flew in Christine's favorite band, [Frenship](https://linktr.ee/wearefrenship)! **Their proposal went viral on TikTok!**

## The Venue

We had the proposal at [The Vail Wedding Island](https://www.vailrec.com/vail-recreation/vail-golf-and-nordic-clubhouse). The location is incredible because it's the only place in Vail where you can get a mountain top view, without going up the gondola. It's rarely available for proposals because in the summer it's used for weddings, and in the winter it's too snowy to get there without cross country skis or snow shoes.

## The Setup

Machi wanted a table for the proposal, so they could enjoy a mini Frenship concert after they got engaged. Since the table was going to be the backdrop for the proposal, I wanted to make it really beautiful, with a simple floral arrangement that would show when he got down on one knee.

**Details included:**
- Oversized velvet runner
- Lanterns to weigh down the table decor
- GH Mumm champagne (their favorite for special occasions)
- Personalized champagne flutes: "Mr. Schmoo" and "Future Mrs. Schmoo" (their nicknames)
- White fur rug for kneeling
- White fur chair covers
- Rose bouquet on the pathway for the first surprise

## The Proposal

Machi told Christine they were going to brunch, and first they were going to stop at a scenic spot to see the mountains on the way. Before heading to the venue, Anthony from Gold Heart Weddings met Machi in the bathroom to mic him up.

My assistant and I pretended to be on a photo shoot, so the photographers and videographers could get footage of the couple picking up the bouquet. Christine thought the bouquet was ours for our photo shoot!

When they turned the corner, Frenship started playing their special song, and the mountains and the setup were revealed! Christine was really surprised, and they were both so happy! We were all tearing up watching it!

**The Ring:** Machi had personally designed Christine's ring, and had it custom made with sapphires - surely symbolic to their relationship.

## After the Proposal

- Face timed their parents
- Enjoyed champagne and a mini Frenship concert
- Machi gave Christine a love letter
- Mini engagement photo shoot
- Rose petal turndown at The Arrabelle with photos and LED candles

Their proposal was perfect, and it was a pleasure and an honor to be a small part of their special day!
