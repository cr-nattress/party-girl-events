# Romantic Vail Wedding Filled with The Prettiest Pastel Florals

I can't think of anything better than Kimmy and Craig's wedding! Every detail was perfect, and the day was filled with so much love!

## Highlights

The couple got ready at The Sonnenalp in Vail Village where the wedding took place. The Sonnenalp is one of my favorite venues. It's stunning!

They had their first look in the village, and then left to take mountain top photos.

The ceremony was beautiful. The deconstructed arch idea was the inspiration for the entire wedding design. It was Kimmy's favorite detail.

The reception was filled with pastel florals and details. Everything came together so perfectly. My favorite detail was the [After The Tone](https://afterthetone.co/) audio guest book.

The dance floor was packed all night! I've never seen anyone use neck ties as a jump rope. It was so fun even I was sad when it was over.

## Kind Words

> Stephanie and her team are a must have for your wedding experience. From the small details to the larger ones she did an outstanding job making sure our wedding was everything we could have asked for and more! She always went out of her way to make herself available and bring life to every single detail at our wedding, including setup, rehearsal, etc. Planning a wedding from a distance was so easy thanks to Stephanie and her team.
