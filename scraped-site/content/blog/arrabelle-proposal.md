# Romantic Candle Lit Proposal at The Arrabelle at Vail Square

Our client, Michael, and his girlfriend, Samantha, have been together for five years, so he wanted to do something really special for Samantha's proposal! Michael really wanted to get engaged at night time, around dinner, so they'd be dressed up, looking their best for the photos. They were staying at [The Arrabelle at Vail Square](https://www.vail.com/Plan-Your-Trip/stay/details/The-Arrabelle-at-Vail-Square-a-RockResort?location=50016544), so I had the perfect idea for the location. The ice skating rink right outside!

## The Pivot

However, we found out at the last minute, that the ice skating rink actually wasn't available, so I knew I had to think of an even better location before giving Michael the bad news. I remembered the pretty staircase outside of the ballroom at The Arrabelle, and luckily that space was available!

## The Setup

I love how it turned out! As a proposal planner, I always consider how the setup will look with my client kneeling in front of it. Initially I was afraid the staircase would look too boring, so we covered it entirely with candles, and added beautiful floral arrangements and candelabras on each side. It looked so romantic! 

We also had a rose petal and candle trail leading from the elevator to the proposal. I initially wanted to scratch that, but the florist refused, and she was right! It was the perfect touch!

## The Moment

When it was time for the proposal, Michael told Samantha there was a special happy hour for hotel guests in the ballroom, and she bought it! She was so surprised!

## Rose Petal Turndown

After the engagement, the couple went to dinner, and I did a rose petal turndown with photos and LED candles in their room.
