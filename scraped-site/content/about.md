# About Party Girl Events

## Stephanie Fleck - Owner

![Stephanie Fleck](../images/Proposal-Session-WP-0081-1.jpg)

For me it's not all about making things pretty (although that's a really fun part of my job). Above & beyond personalized service, anticipating even the unexpressed wishes and needs of our clients, and flawless logistics are the key ingredients to every successful event.

I'm a hospitality queen! I moved to Vail in 2013 for a promotion with The Ritz-Carlton. I was a manager for The Ritz for 8 years, I've worked and lived in Philly, San Francisco, Tucson, and Atlanta. I'm a city girl at heart, but I love Vail so much, so instead of moving to the next Ritz-Carlton, I collected my severance, left the company, and launched Party Girl Events! It was the best decision I've ever made!

I love my mountain lifestyle, and I enjoy hiking and camping in the summer, and skiing in the winter. I also enjoy crafts, working out at The Westin, Going to Wedding & Event Conventions, Spending time with friends, and listening to Taylor Swift. Most of all I love planning events, and going above and beyond to make my clients happy.
