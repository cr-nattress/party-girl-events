## Angle / positioning
Treat the elopement as a curated experience with a simple timeline, an elevated photo plan, and one celebratory “capstone” (dinner, picnic, or mini reception).

- H3: Couple-only vs micro-audience (6–20)

### H2: How to get a “destination feel” locally
- H3: Backdrop selection (desert/coast/mountain/forest/urban iconic)
- H3: Time-of-day planning (sunrise/sunset, crowds)
- H3: Styling details that sell the vibe
  - Outfit, bouquet shape, color palette, footwear, layers
